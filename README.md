In the Software Engineering Lab classes at Fatec Presidente Prudente, taught by Professor Ana Carolina Nicolosi da R. Gracioso, students learn various topics related to software development.

📚 During the classes, topics such as initial JavaScript are covered, where students learn the basics of the JavaScript programming language, including variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.

🌟 Next, students move on to studying JavaScript with object-oriented programming, where they learn to use concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to create more complex and structured programs.

💻 Finally, the classes cover the development of web applications with React, a JavaScript framework used to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Students learn to use components, states, and properties to create modern and interactive web applications.

🔧 All class content is applied in practical activities, where students have the opportunity to put their knowledge into practice and develop real projects. The deploy link https://fatec-lab-engenharia-react.vercel.app is available for students to share and present their projects at the end of the course.
